# ProcessButton

iOS Buttons that animate while an action is being processed. Written in Swift.

This library was extracted from an iOS application that I was working on at the time. It's used for any sort of action that is processed asynchronously, and shows a loading-like animation until the action is done.

## Requirements

* iOS 8 or later
* Xcode 6 or later
